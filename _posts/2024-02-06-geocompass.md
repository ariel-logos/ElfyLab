Geocompass is an add-on for FFXI's third-party loader and hook Ashita (<a href="https://www.ashitaxi.com/" target="_blank">https://www.ashitaxi.com/</a>) customized for CatsEye implementation of GEO's trait Cardinal Chant (<a href="https://www.bg-wiki.com/ffxi/CatsEyeXI_Systems/Jobs#Adjustments_5" target="_blank">https://www.bg-wiki.com/ffxi/CatsEyeXI_Systems/Jobs#Adjustments_5</a>).

The purpose of this add-on is to provide clear tracking of the elemental bonus given by the trait, based on the character orientation.

### How does it work?
It displays a compass pointing at the element for which the character is benefitting from a buff.
