Geocompass is an add-on for FFXI's third-party loader and hook Ashita (https://www.ashitaxi.com/) customized for CatsEye implementation of GEO's trait Cardinal Chant (https://www.bg-wiki.com/ffxi/CatsEyeXI_Systems/Jobs#Adjustments_5).
The purpose of this add-on is to provide clear tracking of the elemental bonus given by the trait, based on the character orientation.
<br></br>  
### What is not?
This add-on is <b>NOT</b> compass working for the original Cardinal Chant implementation (https://www.bg-wiki.com/ffxi/Cardinal_Chant).
I will consider working on this depending on the volume of demand for it.
<br></br>
### How does it work?
It displays a compass pointing at the element for which the character is benefitting from a buff.

<div class="custom-image-container-centered">
	<video style="max-height: 300px;" disablePictureInPicture muted autoplay loop>

</div>
